                               RAMAYANA
   




                               THE STORY


The story of the “Ramayana,” in brief outline, is as follows:

In the ancient land of Kosala, watered by the River Surayu, stood the
famous Ayodhya,[14] a fortified and impregnable city of matchless
beauty, and resplendent with burnished gold, where everyone was
virtuous, beautiful, rich and happy. Wide streets traversed this city
in every direction, lined with elegant shops and stately palaces
glittering all over with gems. There was no lack of food in Ayodhya,
for “it abounded in paddy and rice, and its water was as sweet as
the juice of the sugar-cane.” Gardens, mango-groves and “theatres
for females” were to be found everywhere. Dulcet music from _Venas_
and _Panavas_ resounding on all sides, bore evidence to the taste of
the people. Learned and virtuous Brahmans, skilled in sacrificial
rites, formed a considerable proportion of the population; which also
included a crowd of eulogists and “troops of courtesans.” The pride
of ancient families supported a large number of genealogists. Hosts
of skilled artisans of every kind contributed to the conveniences and
elegancies of life, while an army of doughty warriors protected this
magnificent and opulent city from its envious foes. Over this wonderful
and prosperous capital of a flourishing kingdom, ruled King Dasahratha,
a man some sixty thousand years of age, gifted with every virtue and
blessed beyond most mortals. But, as if to prove that human happiness
can never exist unalloyed with sorrow, even he had one serious cause
for grief; he was childless, although he had three wives and seven
hundred and fifty concubines.[15] Acting upon the advice of the
priests, the Maharajah determined to offer, with all the complicated
but necessary rites, the sacrifice of a horse, as a means of prevailing
upon the gods to bless his house with offspring. The accomplishment
of such a sacrifice was no easy matter, or to be lightly undertaken,
even by a mighty monarch like Dasahratha, since it was an essential
condition of success that the sacrifice should be conducted without
error or omission in the minutest details of the ritual of an intricate
ceremony, extending over three days. Not only would any flaw in the
proceedings render the sacrifice nugatory, but it was to be feared that
learned demons (Brahma-Rakshasas), ever maliciously on the look-out
for shortcomings in the sacrifices attempted by men, might cause the
destruction of the unfortunate performer of an imperfect sacrifice
of such momentous importance. However, the sacrifice was actually
performed on a magnificent scale and most satisfactorily, with the
assistance of an army of artisans, astrologers, dancers, conductors of
theatres, and persons learned in the ceremonial law. Birds, beasts,
reptiles, and aquatic animals were sacrificed by the priests on this
auspicious occasion, but the sacred horse itself was despatched,
with three strokes, by the hand of Kauçalya, Dasahratha’s queen. When
the ceremonies had been conducted to a successful close, Dasahratha
showed his piety and generosity by making a free gift of the whole
earth to the officiating priests; but they were content to restore
the magnificent present, modestly accepting in its stead fabulous
quantities of gold and silver and innumerable cows.

The gods, Gandharvas and Siddhas, propitiated by the offerings
profusely made to them, assembled, each one for his share,[16] and
Dasahratha was promised four sons.[17] While these events were
transpiring, a ten-headed Rakshasa named Ravana was making himself the
terror of gods and men, under the protection of a boon bestowed upon
him by the Creator (Brahma), that neither god nor demon should be able
to deprive him of his life. This boon had been obtained by the Rakshasa
as the reward of long and painful austerities.[18]

The hierarchy of minor gods, in their own interest and for the sake of
the saints who were constantly being disturbed in their devotions by
this Ravana and his fellows, appealed to the Supreme Deity to find some
remedy for the evil. Brahma, after reflecting on the matter, replied--

  “One only way I find
  To stay this fiend of evil mind.
  He prayed me once his life to guard
  From demon, God and heavenly bard,
  And spirits of the earth and air,
  And I consenting heard his prayer.
  But the proud giant in his scorn,
  Recked not of man of woman born,
  None else may take his life away
  But only man the fiend may slay.”
                         --+GRIFFITH.+

On receiving this reply the gods petitioned Vishnu to divide himself
into four parts and to appear on earth, incarnate as the promised sons
of Dasahratha, and thus, in human form, to rid the world of Ravana.
Vishnu consented. He proceeded to the earth and appeared amidst the
sacrificial flames of Dasahratha’s offering, in an assumed form “of
matchless splendour, strength and size”--black, with a red face, and
shaggy hair--apparelled in crimson robes, and adorned with celestial
ornaments, holding in his hands a vase of gold, containing heavenly
nectar, which he handed to the king, with instructions to make his
three queens partake of the sacred draught, in order that they might
be blessed with sons.

Dasahratha distributed the nectar amongst his wives, though not in
equal proportions. In due time the promised sons were born, viz., Rama,
Lakshmana, Bharata and Satrughna. Rama possessed the larger share of
the divine nature and decidedly excelled his brothers in prowess.
To him, especially, was allotted the task of destroying Ravana. And
countless hosts of monkeys and bears were begotten by the gods, at
Brahma’s[19] suggestion, to aid him in his work.

Whilst yet a mere stripling, Rama was appealed to by the sage
Vishwamitra to destroy certain demons who interrupted the religious
rites of the hermits.

The boy was only sixteen years of age, and Dasahratha, naturally
solicitous for his safety, declined to let him go to fight the dreadful
brood of demons, who had an evil reputation for cruelty and ferocity;
but the mighty ascetic waxed so wrath at this refusal of his request,
that “the entire earth began to tremble and the gods even were inspired
with awe.” Vasishta, the king’s spiritual adviser, who had unbounded
confidence in Vishwamitra’s power to protect the prince from all harm,
strongly advised compliance with the ascetic’s request, and Dasahratha
was prevailed upon to allow Rama and Lakshmana to leave Ayodhya with
Vishwamitra.

The incidents of the journey reveal a very primitive state of society.
The princes and their guide were all of them on foot, apparently
quite unattended by servants and unprovided with even the most
ordinary necessaries of life. When they reached the River Surayu,[20]
Vishwamitra communicated certain _mantras_ or spells to Rama, by the
knowledge of which he would be protected from fatigue and fever[21] and
from the possibility of being surprised by the Rakshasas against whom
he was going to wage war.

The land through which our travellers journeyed was sparsely inhabited.
A goodly portion of it seems to have been covered with woods, more or
less pleasant, abounding in the hermitages of ascetics, some of whom
had been carrying on their austerities for _thousands of years_. Beside
these pleasant woods there were vast, trackless forests, infested
by ferocious beasts and grim Rakshasas, and it was not long before
the might of the semi-divine stripling, Rama, was tried against one
of these terrible creatures, Tarika by name, an ogress of dreadful
power, whom Rama undertook to destroy “in the interests of Brahmans,
kine and celestials.” When the ascetic and the two princes arrived in
the dark forest where the dreaded Tarika ruled supreme, Rama twanged
his bowstring loudly, as a haughty challenge to this redoubtable
giantess. Incensed at the audacious sound of the bowstring, Tarika
uttered terrible roars and rushed out to attack the presumptuous
prince. The ascetic raised a defiant roar in response. That was his
entire contribution to the combat in which Rama and his adversary were
immediately involved, Lakshmana taking part in it also. This, the
first conflict in which Rama was engaged, may be taken as a type of
all his subsequent battles. Raising clouds of dust, Tarika, “by help
of illusion,” poured a shower of huge stones upon the brothers, but
these ponderous missiles were met and arrested in mid-air by a volley
of arrows. The battle raged fiercely, but the brothers succeeded with
their shafts in depriving Tarika of her hands, her nose and her ears.
Thus disabled and disfigured, Tarika changed her shape[22] and even
concealed herself from view, while still continuing the fight with
unabated fury; but Rama, guided by sound alone, assailed his invisible
foe with such effect that he eventually laid her dead at his feet, to
the joy of Vishwamitra and the relief of the denizens of the great
forest over which she had terrorized.

After this successful combat, the ascetic, Vishwamitra, conferred
on Rama a gift of strange weapons, which even the celestials were
incapable of wielding. How very different the magic weapons received by
Rama were from those familiar to the sons of men, will be apparent from
the poet’s statement that the weapons themselves made their appearance
spontaneously before Rama, “and with clasped hands, they, well-pleased,
addressed Rama thus: These, O highly generous one, are thy servants, O
Raghava. Whatever thou wishest, good betide thee, shall by all means be
accomplished by us.”

Such wonderful and efficient weapons, endowed with a consciousness and
individuality of their own, needed, however, to be kept under strict
control, lest in their over-zeal or excitement they might effect
undesigned and irreparable mischief. The sage accordingly communicated
to Rama the various _mantras_ or spells by which they might, on
critical occasions, be restrained and regulated in their operations.

In their woodland wanderings amongst the hermitages the brothers and
their guide came across many sages whose laborious austerities were
constantly being hindered by wicked, flesh-eating Rakshasas. Indeed
the world, outside the cities and villages,--which it would seem were
very few and far between,--as pictured by Valmiki, is a very strange
one, mostly peopled by two sets of beings, _hermits_ striving after
supernatural power through the practice of austerities, and _demons_
bent on frustrating their endeavours by unseasonable interruptions of
their rites, or impious pollution of their sacrifices. Sometimes, as in
the case of Ravana, the demons themselves would practise austerities
for the attainment of power.

Very prominent figures in the poem are the great ascetics, like
Vishwamitra himself, who, a Kshatriya by caste and a king by lineage,
had obtained, through dire austerities prolonged over thousands of
years, the exalted rank and power of _Brahmanhood_. A single example of
his self-inflicted hardships and the consequences resulting therefrom
may not be out of place. He once restrained his breath for a thousand
years, when vapours began to issue from his head, “and at this the
three worlds became afflicted with fear.” Like most of his order,
he was a very proud and irate personage, ready, upon very slight
provocation, to utter a terrible and not-to-be-escaped-from curse.[23]
Once, in a fit of rage against the celestials, Vishwamitra created
entire systems of stars and even threatened, in his fury, to create
another India by “the process of his self-earned asceticism.”

The life led by the princely brothers in their pedestrian wanderings
with this mighty sage was simplicity itself. They performed their
religious rites regularly, adoring the rising sun, the blazing fire or
the flowing river, as the case might be. Their sojourn in the forests
was enlivened by pleasant communion with the hermits to whose kind
hospitality they were usually indebted for a night’s lodging, if such
it can be called, and a simple fare of milk and fruits. Vishwamitra
added interest to their journeyings by satisfying the curiosity of
the brothers in regard to the history of the several places they
visited. Here, as he informed them, the god Rudra had performed his
austerities--for even the gods were not above the necessity and
ambition of ascetic practices--and blasted the impious Kama into
nothingness with a breath. There, the great god Vishnu of mighty
asceticism, worshipped of all the deities, dwelt during hundreds of
_Yugas_, for the purpose of carrying on his austerities and practising
_yoga_.[24] At one time Vishwamitra would relate the history of the
origin of Ganga and of her descent upon the earth, as the mighty and
purifying Ganges, chief of rivers. At another time he would himself
listen complacently, along with his princely companions, to the history
of his own wonderful asceticism and marvellous performances, as the
wise Satananda related it for the special edification of Rama.

So passed away the time in the forests, not altogether peacefully,
however, for the object of the journey would not have been fulfilled
without sundry fierce and entirely successful encounters with the
Rakshasas, those fiendish interrupters of sacrifice and persistent
enemies of the anchorites. Eventually the wanderers came to the kingdom
of Mithila, whose king, Janaka,[25] had a lovely daughter to bestow
upon the worthy and fortunate man who should bend a certain formidable
bow which had belonged to Siva and which he had once threatened to use
in the destruction of the gods.

Janaka’s daughter, the famous Sita, whose matrimonial future was thus
connected with Siva’s bow, was of superhuman origin, having sprung from
the earth in a mysterious manner; for, while Janaka was ploughing the
ground in the course of a child-conferring sacrifice, the lovely maiden
had, by the favour of the gods, come to him out of the furrow.

Allured by the fame of Sita’s beauty, suitor after suitor had come to
Mithila and tried that tough bow of Siva’s, but without success; and
Rama’s curiosity was awakened about both the mighty weapon and the
maiden fair.

Having been introduced by Vishwamitra to the King of Mithila, Rama
was allowed to essay his strength against the huge bow, and huge it
was indeed, for it had to be carried on an eight-wheeled cart which
“was with difficulty drawn along by five thousand stalwart persons of
well-developed frames.” To Rama, however, the bending of this gigantic
bow was an easy matter, and he not only bent but broke it too, at which
event all present, overwhelmed by the noise, rolled head over heels,
with the exception of Vishwamitra, the “king and the two Raghavas.”
The lovely and much-coveted prize was Rama’s of course. Arrangements
for the wedding were carried out in grand style. Dasahratha and his
two other sons were invited to Mithila and brides were found, in the
family of Janaka, for all the _four_ brothers. Upon a daïs covered with
a canopy, and decked with flowers, the happy brides and bridegrooms
were placed, attended by the king and the priests of the two families.
Water-pots, golden ladles, censers, and conches, together with
platters containing rice, butter, curds and other things for the _Hom_
sacrifice, were also arranged for use on the platform. The sacrificial
fire was lighted, the appropriate _mantras_ repeated, and the four
bridegrooms led their brides first round the fire, and then round the
king and the priests. At this stage of the proceedings showers of
celestial flowers rained down upon the happy couples, now united in the
bonds of matrimony.[26] After these marriages the return to Ayodhya was
accomplished with rejoicings and in great state; but Vishwamitra took
his solitary way to the Northern Mountains.

As the years went by and Rama was grown to man’s estate he was endowed
with every princely virtue; the people idolized him, and his father,
desirous of retiring from the cares of government, determined to place
him upon the throne. But, although apparently simple of execution,
this arrangement was beset with difficulties. Rama was the son of the
Rajah’s eldest and principal wife; but Bharata was the son of his
favourite wife, the slender-waisted Kaikeyi. The suffrages of the
people and Dasahratha’s own wishes were entirely in favour of Rama,
but, apparently unwilling to face the grief or opposition of his
darling Kaikeyi, the king took advantage of Bharata’s absence on a
visit to a distant court to carry out the rather sudden preparations
for Rama’s installation as Yuva-Rajah, hoping, it would seem, to keep
Kaikeyi in complete ignorance of what was being done. The whole city,
however, was in a state of bustle and excitement at the approaching
event. The streets were being washed and watered, flag-staffs were
being erected on every side, gay bunting was floating about and
garlands of flowers adorned the houses. Musicians played in the
highways and in the temples, and, notwithstanding the seclusion
of the women’s apartments, it was impossible to conceal from the
inmates of the _zenana_ what was going on in the great world outside.
A deformed and cunning slave-girl, named Manthara, found out and
revealed the whole plot to Bharata’s mother. At first Kaikeyi received
the intelligence with pleasure, for Rama was dear to everybody; but
the slave-girl so worked upon her feelings of envy and jealousy, by
artfully picturing to her the very inferior position she would hold in
the world’s estimation, the painful slights she would have to endure
and the humiliation she would have to suffer, once Kauçalya’s son was
raised to the throne, that in a passion of rage and grief, she threw
away her ornaments and, with dishevelled hair, flew to the “_chamber
of sorrow_” and flung herself down upon the floor, weeping bitterly.
Here the old king found her “like a sky enveloped in darkness with the
stars hid” and had to endure the angry reproaches of his disconsolate
favourite. Acting upon a suggestion of the deformed slave-girl, the
queen reminded her husband of a promise made by him long previously,
that he would grant her any two requests she might make. She now
demanded the fulfilment of the royal promise, her two requests being
that Rama should be sent away into banishment in the forests for
a period of fourteen years and that her own son Bharata should be
elevated to the dignity of Yuva-Rajah. On these terms, and on these
only, would the offended and ambitious Kaikeyi be reconciled to her
uxorious lord. If these conditions were refused she was resolved to
rid the king of her hated presence. Dasahratha, poor old man, was
overwhelmed by this unexpected crisis. He fell at his wife’s feet,
he explained that preparations for Rama’s installation had already
commenced, he besought her not to expose him to ridicule and contempt,
he coaxed and flattered her, alluding to her lovely eyes and shapely
hips, he extolled Rama’s affectionate devotion to herself. He next
heaped bitter reproaches upon Kaikeyi’s unreasonable pride and finally
swooned away in despair. But she was firm in her purpose and would not
be shaken by anything, kind or unkind, that this “lord of earth” could
say to her. The royal word she knew was sacred, and had to be kept at
any cost.

As soon as it came to be known what a strange and unforeseen turn
events had taken, the female apartments were the scene of loud
lamentations, and the entire city was plunged in mourning. Rama, of
expansive and coppery eyes,[27] long-armed, dark blue like a lotus, a
mighty bowman of matchless strength, with the gait of a mad elephant,
brave, truthful, humble-minded, respectful and generous to Brahmans,
and having his passions under complete control, was the idol of the
zenana, the court, and the populace. The thought of his unmerited
banishment to the forests was intolerable to everyone. But he himself,
with exemplary filial devotion, prepared to go into exile at once,
without a murmur. The poet devotes considerable space to a minute
description of the sorrow experienced by the prominent characters in
the story on account of Rama’s banishment. Each one indulges in a
lengthy lamentation, picturing the privations and sufferings of the
ill-fated trio, and nearly everyone protests that it will be impossible
to live without Rama. With affectionate regard for Sita’s comfort, and
loving apprehension for her safety, Rama resolved to leave her behind
with his mother; but no argument, no inducement, could prevail upon
the devoted wife to be parted from her beloved husband. What were the
terrors of the forest to her, what the discomfort of the wilderness,
when shared with Rama? Racked with sorrow at the proposed separation,
Sita burst into a flood of tears and became almost insensible with
grief. At the sight of her tribulation Rama, overcome with emotion,
threw his arms about his dear wife and agreed to take her with him,
come what may.

Lakshmana, with devoted loyalty, would also accompany his brother into
exile.

Kaikeyi, apprehensive of delays, hurried on their preparations, and
herself, unblushingly, provided them with the bark dresses worn by
ascetics. The two brothers donned their new vestments in the king’s
presence.

  “But Sita, in her silks arrayed,
  Threw glances, trembling and afraid,
  On the bark coat she had to wear
  Like a shy doe that eyes the snare.
  Ashamed and weeping for distress
  From the queen’s hand she took the dress.
  The fair one, by her husband’s side,
  Who matched heaven’s minstrel monarch, cried:
  ‘How bind they on their woodland dress,
  Those hermits of the wilderness?’
  There stood the pride of Janak’s race
  Perplexed, with sad appealing face,
  One coat the lady’s fingers grasped,
  One round her neck she feebly clasped,
  But failed again, again, confused
  By the wild garb she ne’er had used.
  Then quickly hastening Rama, pride
  Of all who cherish virtue, tied
  The rough bark mantle on her, o’er
  The silken raiment that she wore.
  Then the sad women when they saw
  Rama the choice bark round her draw,
  Rained water from each tender eye
  And cried aloud with bitter cry.”[28]
                             --+GRIFFITH.+

After giving away vast treasures to the Brahmans the ill-fated trio
took a pathetic leave of the now miserable old king, of Kauçalya
who mourned like a cow deprived of her calf, of Sumitra the mother
of Lakshmana, and of their “other three hundred and fifty mothers.”
With an exalted sense of filial duty the exiles also bid a respectful
and affectionate farewell to Kaikeyi, the cruel author of their
unmerited banishment, Rama remarking that it was not her own heart,
but “_Destiny_ alone that had made her press for the prevention of his
installation.”

When Rama and his companions appeared in the streets of the capital,
in the dress of ascetics, the populace loudly deplored their fate,
extolling the virtues of Rama while giving vent to their feelings of
disapproval at the king’s weak compliance with his favourite’s whim.
Sita came in for her share of popular pity and admiration, since she
“whom formerly the very rangers of the sky could not see, was to-day
beheld by every passer-by.”

A royal chariot conveyed away to the inhospitable wilderness the two
brothers and faithful Sita, torn from stately Ayodhya, their luxurious
palaces and the arms of their fond parents. All they carried with them,
in the chariot, was their armour and weapons, “a basket bound in hide
and a hoe.” Crowds of people, abandoning their homes, followed in the
track of the chariot, resolved to share the fate of the exiles. And
such was the grief of the people that the dust raised by the wheels
of the car occupied by Rama and his companions was laid by the tears
of the citizens. They drove at once to the jungles and rested there
for the night. During the hours of slumber the exiles considerately
gave their followers the slip and hurried off, in the chariot, towards
the great forest of Dandhaka. When they arrived at the banks of the
sacred and delightful Ganges the charioteer was dismissed with
tender messages to the old king from his exiled children. After the
departure of the charioteer Rama and his companions began their forest
wanderings on foot. Their hermit-life was now to commence in earnest.
Before entering the dark forests that lay before them, the brothers
resolved to wear “that ornament of ascetics, a head of matted hair,”
and, accordingly, produced the desired _coiffure_ with the aid of the
glutinous sap of the banyan tree. Thus prepared and clothed in bark
like the saints, the brothers, with faithful Sita, entered a boat
which chanced to be at the river-side and began the passage of the
Ganges. As they crossed the river the pious Sita, with joined hands,
addressed the goddess of the sacred stream, praying for a happy return
to Ayodhya, when their days of exile should be over. Having arrived
on the other bank, the exiles entered the forest in Indian file,
Lakshmana leading and Rama bringing up the rear. Passing by Sringavara
on the Ganges, they proceeded to Prayaga at the junction of the Ganges
and the Jumna. Here they were hospitably entertained by the sage
Bharadvaja, who recommended them to seek an asylum on the pleasant
slopes of wooded Chitrakuta. On the way thither Sita, ever mindful of
her religious duties, adored the Kalindi river--which they crossed on
a raft constructed by themselves--and paid her respects to a gigantic
banyan tree, near which many ascetics had taken up their abode. On the
romantic and picturesque side of Chitrakuta the exiles built themselves
a cottage, thatched with leaves, “walled with wood, and furnished with
doors.” Game, fruits, and roots abounded in the neighbourhood, so
that they need have no anxiety about their supplies. So much did they
appreciate the quiet beauties of their sylvan retreat, the cool shade,
the perfumed flowers, the sparkling rivulets and the noble river, that
they became almost reconciled to their separation from their friends
and the lordly palaces of Ayodhya, in which city important things were
happening.

The exile of Rama had been too much for the doting old Maharajah.[29]
Weighed down by sorrow, he soon succumbed to his troubles, and Bharata,
who was still absent at Giri-braja, was hastily summoned to take up the
regal office. He, accompanied by his brother Satrughna, hurried to the
capital, and finding, on his arrival, how matters really stood, heaped
reproaches upon his wicked, ambitious mother, indignantly refusing to
benefit by her artful machinations. In a transport of grief Bharata
“fell to the earth sighing like an enraged snake,” while Satrughna,
on his part, seized the deformed slave-girl Manthara, and literally
shook the senses out of her. In Rama’s absence, Bharata performed his
father’s obsequies with great pomp. The dead body of the late king,
which had been preserved in oil, was carried in procession to the river
side and there burnt, together with heaps of boiled rice and sacrificed
animals. A few days later the _sraddha_ ceremonies for the welfare of
the spirit of the departed king were performed, and, as usual, costly
presents,--money, lands, houses, goats and kine, also servant-men and
servant-maids were bestowed upon the fortunate Brahmans.

When this pious duty, which occupied thirteen days, had been fulfilled,
affairs of State demanded attention. Bharata, although pressed to do
so, resolutely declined to accept the sceptre, and resolved to set out,
with a vast following, on a visit to Rama in his retreat, hoping to
persuade him to abandon his hermit-life and undertake the government
of the realm. Great preparations had to be made for this visit to
Rama, which was a sort of wholesale exodus of the people of Ayodhya
of all ranks and occupations. A grand army was to accompany Bharata,
and the court, with all the ladies of the royal family, including
the no-doubt-reluctant Kaikeyi, were to swell the procession. A road
had to be made for the projected march of this host; streams had to
be bridged, ferries provided at the larger rivers, and able guides
secured. When the road was ready and the preparations for the journey
completed, chariots and horsemen in thousands crowded the way, mingled
with a vast multitude of citizens riding in carts. Artificers of every
kind attended the royal camp. Armourers, weavers, tailors, potters,
glass-makers, goldsmiths and gem-cutters, were there; so also were
physicians, actors and shampooers, peacock-dancers and men whose
profession it was to provide warm baths for their customers. Of course
the Brahman element was strongly represented in this great procession
from the flourishing city to the solitudes of the forest. Bharata’s
march is described at great length by the poet; but only one incident
need be mentioned here. On the way the hermit Bharadvaja, desirous of
doing Bharata honour, and probably not unwilling to display his power,
invited him and his followers, of whom, as we have seen, there were
many thousands, to a feast at his hermitage. At the command of the
saint the forest became transformed into lovely gardens, abounding in
flowers and fruit. Palaces of matchless beauty sprang into existence.
Music filled the cool and perfumed air. Food and drink, including meat
and wine, appeared in profusion:--soups and curries are especially
mentioned, and the flesh of goats and bears, deer, peacocks and cocks;
also rice, milk and sugar. In addition to all this, a host of heavenly
nymphs from Swarga descended to indulge in soft dalliance with the
ravished warriors of Bharata’s army.

  “Then beauteous women, seven or eight,
  Stood ready by each man to wait.
  Beside the stream his limbs they stripped,
  And in the cooling water dipped,
  And then the fair ones, sparkling-eyed,
  With soft hands rubbed his limbs and dried,
  And sitting on the lovely bank
  Held up the wine-cup as he drank.”
                                --+GRIFFITH.+

For one day and one night the intoxicating enjoyment continued; and
then, at the word of command, all the creations of the sage’s power
vanished, leaving the forest in its wonted gloom.

Having taken a respectful leave of the mighty ascetic, Bharata and his
followers threaded their way through the dense forests towards the
Mountain Chitrakuta and the River Mandakini. After a long march they at
last found the object of their desire, the high-souled Rama, “seated in
a cottage, bearing a head of matted locks, clad in black deerskin and
having tattered cloth and bark for his garment.” When Rama heard of his
father’s death he was deeply moved and fell insensible upon the ground,
“like a blooming tree that hath been hewn by an axe.” The loving
Vaidehi (Sita) and the brothers Lakshmana and Bharata sprinkled water
on the face of the prostrate man and restored him to animation, when
he at once burst into loud and prolonged lamentations. Presently Rama
pulled himself together and duly performed the funeral rites, pouring
out libations of water and making an offering of _ingudi_ fruits to
the spirit of his departed father. These offerings were not worthy of
being presented to the manes of so great a man as Dasahratha; but were
justifiable, under the circumstances of the case, on the accepted
principle that “that which is the fare of an individual is also the
fare of his divinities.”[30] Bharata and the rest, respectfully sitting
before Rama with joined hands, entreated him, with the greatest
humility, to undertake the reins of government; but he was not to be
persuaded to do so. He would not break the resolution he had made, nor
would he be disloyal to his dead father’s commands. Then Javali, a
Brahman atheist, insisting that there was and could be no hereafter,
that Dasahratha, once his sire, was now mere nothing, advised the
prince to yield to the reasonable wishes of the living and return
with them to rule over the kingdom of his ancestors. Rama, however,
warmly rebuked the atheist for his impiety, and all that Bharata could
accomplish was merely to induce him to put off from his feet a pair of
sandals adorned with gold, which he (Bharata) carried back with him
in great state to the deserted Ayodhya--now inhabited only by cats
and owls--as a visible symbol of his brother Rama, in whose name he
undertook to carry on the affairs of the State until the appointed
fourteen years of exile should have run their course.

The incidents connected with Rama’s exile to the forests, his life
and rambles at Chitrakuta, Bharata’s imposing march through the same
wooded country which the exiles had traversed, affords the poet of
the “Ramayana” rare opportunities of displaying his love for the
picturesque and his strong natural leaning towards the serene, if
uneventful, life of the hermit. Often in these early forest rovings,
and indeed throughout the fourteen years of exile, does Rama, or
some other one, linger to note and admire the beauties of woodland
and landscape, and to hold loving communion with the fair things of
field and forest. Though he praises the cities, and pictures their
grandeur of gold and gems, it is plain throughout that the poet’s
heart is in the woods, displaying on his part an appreciation of
the charms of nature and scenery, very remarkable, indeed, when we
consider how slowly the taste for the beauties of inanimate nature was
developed in Europe. After Bharata’s return to Ayodhya, Rama and his
companions moved further southwards, in the direction of the great
forest of Dandhaka, which extended indeed as far as the Godavari. In
their wanderings they came to the abode of a certain ascetic whose
wife, having performed severe austerities for ten thousand years,
was privileged, during ten years of drought, to create fruits and
roots for the sustenance of the people and to divert the course of
the river Jumna, so that its waters should flow by the thirsty asylum
of the hermits. This ancient dame took a great fancy to Vaidehi,
and, woman-like, gave her fair disciple a worthy gift, consisting of
fine apparel, of beautiful ornaments, a precious cosmetic for the
beautification of her person, and a rare garland of flowers. Nor was
the old lady contented until she had seen the effect of her present on
Janaka’s charming daughter, who had pleased her much by her good sense
in affirming that “the asceticism of woman is ministering unto her
husband.”

Wheresoever the exiles turned their steps, in these almost trackless
forests, they were told of the evil doings of the Rakshasas, who not
only interrupted the sacrifices, but actually carried off and devoured
the anchorites. Very curious, too, were the ways in which some of these
Rakshasas compassed the destruction of the saints. One of them, the
wily Ilwala, well acquainted with Sanskrit, would assume the form of
a Brahman and invite the hermits to a _sraddha_ feast. His brother,
in the assumed form of a sheep, would be slaughtered and cooked for
his guests. When they had enjoyed their repast the cruel Ilwala
would command his brother Vatapi to “come forth,” which he would do
unreluctantly, and with a vengeance, bleating loudly and rending the
bodies of the unhappy guests, of whom thousands were disposed of in
this truly Rakshasa fashion. It is noteworthy that those ascetics who
had, by long and severe austerities, acquired a goodly store of merit,
might easily have made short work of the Rakshasas; but, on the other
hand, if they allowed their angry passions to rise, even against such
impious beings, they would, while punishing their tormentors, have
inevitably lost the entire advantage of their long and painful labours.
Hence many of the hermits made a direct appeal to Rama for protection.

Entering the forest of Dandhaka the exiles encountered a huge, terrible
and misshapen monster, besmeared with fat and covered with blood,
who was roaring horribly with his widely distended mouth, while with
his single spear he held transfixed before him quite a menagerie of
lions, tigers, leopards and other wild animals. This awful being
rushed towards the trio, and, quick as thought, snatched up the gentle
Vaidehi in his arms, bellowing out “I am a Rakshasa, Viradha by name.
This forest is my fortress. Accoutred in arms I range (here), feeding
on the flesh of ascetics. This transcendantly beauteous one shall be
my wife. And in battle I shall drink your blood, wretches that ye
are.” At this juncture, Rama, as on some other trying occasions, gave
way to unseasonable lamentations and tears; but Lakshmana, always
practical, bravely recalled him to the necessity of immediate action.
The Rakshasa, having ascertained who his opponents were, vauntingly
assured them that, having gratified Brahma by his asceticism, he had
obtained this boon from him, that no one in the world could slay him
with weapons; and he mockingly advised the princes to renounce Sita
and go their way. But Rama’s wrath was now kindled, and he began a
vigorous attack upon the monster, piercing him with many arrows. A
short, though fierce, combat ensued, the result being that the Rakshasa
seized and carried off both Rama and Lakshmana on his ample shoulders.
His victory now seemed complete, and Sita,--who had apparently been
dropped during the combat,--dreading to be left alone in the terrible
wilderness, piteously implored the monster (whom she insinuatingly
addressed as the “best of Rakshasas”) to take her and to release the
noble princes. The sound of her dear voice acted like a charm upon the
brothers, and, with a vigorous and simultaneous effort, they broke both
the monster’s arms at once, and then attacked him with their _fists_.
They brought him to the ground exhausted, and Rama, planting his foot
upon the throat of his prostrate foe, directed Lakshmana to dig a deep
pit for his reception, and when it was ready, they flung him into it.
The dying monster, thus overcome, _though not with weapons_, explained
that he had been imprisoned in that dreadful form of his by the curse
of a famous ascetic, and was destined to be freed from it only by the
hand of Rama. With this explanation the spirit of the departed Viradha
passed into the celestial regions.

Rama, with his wife and brother, now sought the hermitage of the sage
Sarabhanga, and on approaching it, a strange, unexpected and imposing
sight presented itself to Rama’s view:--Indra, attended by his court,
in conversation with the forest sage! The god of heaven, in clean
apparel and adorned with celestial jewels, was seated in a wondrous
car drawn by green horses up in the sky. Over him was expanded a
spotless umbrella, and two lovely damsels waved gold-handled _chowrees_
above his head. About him were bands of resplendent celestials hymning
his praises.

At Rama’s approach the god withdrew and the sage advised the prince to
seek the guidance of another ascetic named Sutikshna, adding, “This
is thy course, thou best of men. Do thou now, my child, for a space
look at me while I leave off my limbs, even as a serpent renounces
its slough.” Then kindling a sacrificial fire, and making oblations
to it with the appropriate _mantras_, Sarabhanga entered the flames
himself. The fire consumed his old decrepit body, and he was gradually
transformed, in the midst of the flames, into a splendid youth of
dazzling brightness, and, mounting upwards, ascended to the heaven of
Brahma. After Sarabhanga had left the earth in this striking manner,
bands of ascetics waited on Rama, reminded him of his duty as a king,
and solicited his protection against the Rakshasas. As Rama and his
companions wandered on through the forests another wonder soon engaged
their attention. Sweet music reached them from beneath the waters of a
charming lake covered with lotuses, and on inquiring about the strange
phenomenon, a hermit told them that a great ascetic had formed that
lake. By his fierce austerities, extending over ten thousand years,
he had acquired such a store of merit that the gods, with Agni at
their head, began to fear that he desired a position of equality with
themselves. To lure him away from such ideas they sent him five lovely
Apsaras to try the power of their charms upon him. Sage though he
was, he succumbed to their allurements, and now, weaned from his old
ambitions, he passed his time in youth and happiness--the reward of
his austerities and _yoga_ practices--in the company of the seductive
sirens whose sweet voices, blending with the tinklings of their
instruments, came softly to the ears of the wandering princes.

Sita, who had confidently followed her husband, like his very shadow,
through all these adventurous years in the forest, seems at length to
have been somewhat shaken by the very risky encounter with Viradha,
of which she had been an unwilling and terrified eye-witness, in
which her own person had been the object of contention, and which
had threatened, at one critical moment, to end very tragically for
her and her loved ones. Under the influence of these recent and
impressive experiences, Sita ventured, in her gentle, womanly way, to
suggest to her husband the advisability of avoiding all semblance of
hostility towards the Rakshasas. There were, she timidly assured her
husband, three sins to which desire gave rise: untruthfulness, the
coveting of other men’s wives, and the wish to indulge in unnecessary
hostilities. Of untruthfulness, and of allowing his thoughts to stray
towards other women, Sita unhesitatingly exonerated her lord; but
she artfully insinuated that, in his dealings with the Rakshasas, he
was giving way to the sin of provoking hostilities without adequate
cause, and she advised his laying aside his arms during his wanderings
in the forest; since the mere carrying of bows and arrows was enough
to kindle the wish to use them. To give point to this contention,
Vaidehi related how, in the olden time, there lived in the woods a
truthful ascetic whose incessant austerities Indra desired, for some
reason or other, to frustrate. For the attainment of his end the king
of heaven visited the hermit in the guise of a warrior, and left his
sword with him as a trust. Scrupulously regardful of his obligation
to his visitor, the ascetic carried the sword with him wherever duty
or necessity directed his footsteps, till constant association with
the weapon began to engender fierce sentiments, leading eventually to
the spiritual downfall of the poor ascetic, whose ultimate portion was
hell. Rama received Sita’s advice in the loving spirit in which it was
offered, and thanking her for it, explained that it was his _duty_ to
protect the saints from the oppression of the evil Rakshasas, and that
Kshatriyas carried bows in order that the word “distressed” might not
be known on this earth.

Several years of exile slipped away, not unpleasantly, in the shady
forests through which the royal brothers roamed from hermitage to
hermitage, always accompanied by the lovely and faithful Sita, whose
part throughout is one of affectionate, unfaltering and unselfish
devotion to her husband. On the banks of the Godavari, Lakshmana, who
has to do all the hard work for the party, built them a spacious hut
of clay, leaves and bamboos, propped with pillars and furnished with a
fine level floor, and there they lived happily near the rushing river.
At length the brothers got involved in a contest with a brood of giants
who roved about the woods of Dandhaka, delighting, as usual, in the
flesh of hermits and the interruption of sacred rites. This time it
was a woman who was at the bottom of their troubles. Surpanakha, an
ugly giantess and sister of Ravana, charmed with the beauty and grace
of Rama, came to him, and, madly in love, offered to be his wife. But
Rama in flattering terms put her off, saying he was already married.
In sport, apparently, he bid her try her luck with Lakshmana. She took
his advice, but Lakshmana does not seem to have been tempted by the
offer, and, while artfully addressing her as “supremely charming and
superbly beautiful lady,” advised her to become the younger wife of
Rama, to whom he referred her again. Enraged by this double rejection,
the giantess attempted to kill Sita, as the hated obstacle to the
fulfilment of her desires. The brothers, of course, interposed, and
Lakshmana, always impetuous, punished the monster by cutting off her
nose. Surpanakha fled away to her brother Khara, and roused the giant
Rakshasas to avenge her wounds. These terrible giants possessed the
power of changing their forms at will; but their numbers and their
prowess were alike of little avail against the valour and skill of
Rama, who, alone and unaided,--for he sent Lakshmana away with Sita
into an inaccessible cave,--destroyed fourteen thousand of them in a
single day. The combat, which was witnessed by the gods and Gandharvas,
Siddhas and Charanas, is described at great length, and the narrative
is copiously interspersed with the boastful speeches of the rival
chiefs. In the bewildering conflict of that day his fourteen thousand
assailants poured upon Rama showers of arrows, rocks, and trees.
Coming to close quarters they attacked him vigorously with clubs,
darts, and nooses. Although hard pressed and sorely wounded, the hero
maintained the conflict with undaunted courage, sending such thousands
of wonderful arrows from his bow that the sun was darkened and the
missiles of his enemies warded off by them. Finally Rama succeeded
in laying dead upon that awful field of carnage nearly the entire
number of his fierce assailants. Khara, the leader of the opposing
host, a worthy adversary and possessed of wondrous weapons, still
lived. Enraged at, but undaunted by, the wholesale destruction of
his followers, Khara boldly continued the fight. In his war-chariot,
bright as the sun, he seemed to be the Destroyer himself, as he
fiercely assailed the victorious Rama. With one arrow he severed the
hero’s bow in his hand; with seven other shafts like thunder-bolts
he severed his armour joints, so that the glittering mail fell from
his body. He next wounded the prince with a thousand darts. Not yet
overcome, however, Rama strung another bow, the mighty bow of Vishnu,
and discharging shafts with golden feathers, brought Khara’s standard
to the ground. Transported with wrath at this ill-omened event, Khara
poured five arrows into Rama’s bosom. The prince responded with six
terrible bolts, some of them crescent-headed. One struck the chief
in the head, two of the others entered his arms, and the remaining
three his chest. Following these up with thirteen of the same kind,
Rama destroyed his enemy’s chariot, killed his horses, decapitated his
charioteer, and shattered his bow in his grasp. Khara jumped to the
ground armed with a mace, ready to renew the conflict. At this juncture
Rama paused a moment to read the Rakshasa a homily on his evil doings;
the latter replied with fierce boasts, and hurled his mace at Rama,
who cut it into two fragments with his arrows as it sped through the
air. Khara now uprooted a lofty tree and hurled it at his foe; but, as
before, Rama cut it into pieces with his arrow ere it reached him, and
with a shaft resembling fire put a period to the life of the gallant
Rakshasa. At this conclusion of the conflict the celestials sounded
their kettle-drums, and showered down flowers upon the victorious son
of Dasahratha. Thus perished the Rakshasa army and its mighty leader:

  “But of the host of giants one,
  Akampan, from the field had run,
  And sped to Lanka to relate
  In Ravana’s ear the demon’s fate.”
                       --+GRIFFITH.+

This fugitive made his way to the court of Ravana, the king of the
giants, and related to him the sad fate of his followers. Close on the
heels of Akampan came Surpanakha herself, with her cruelly mutilated
face. Transported with rage at the destruction of his armies and
at sight of the disfigured countenance of his sister, the terrible
Rakshasa chief vowed vengeance on Rama and Lakshmana. But the necessity
for great caution in dealing with such valorous foes was apparent, and
Ravana did not seem over-anxious to leave his comfortable capital,
Lanka, in order to seek out the formidable brothers in the woods of
Dandhaka. But Surpanakha, scorned and mutilated, was thirsting for an
early and bitter revenge. Reproaching her brother for his unkingly
supineness, she artfully gave him a description of Sita’s beauty,
far superior to that of any goddess, which served to kindle unlawful
desires in his heart. She referred to Vaidehi’s golden complexion, her
moon-like face, her lotus eyes, her slender waist, her taper fingers,
her swelling bosom, her ample hips and lovely thighs, till the giant
was only too willing to assent to her suggestion, that the most
effectual and agreeable revenge he could take for the destruction of
his hosts, and the cruel insults to his sister, would be to carry off
the fair Sita, by stratagem, from the arms of her devoted husband, and
thus add the lovely daughter of Janaka to the number, not very small,
of the beauties who adorned his palace at Lanka. We shall presently see
that the plot was ingeniously contrived and too successfully carried
out.

How conveniently the race of Rakshasas could assume at will the forms
in which they chose to appear, we know already. Taking advantage of
this faculty of metamorphosis, a Rakshasa named Maricha, in obedience
to Ravana’s orders, showed himself near Rama’s hermitage, in the
shape of a wonderful golden deer, spotted with silver, having horns
resembling jewels, a belly like a sapphire, and sides like _madbuka_
flowers. The strange creature captivated the fancy of Sita, and she
was so eager to possess it, alive or dead, that Rama was induced to go
in pursuit of it. Suspecting mischief from this unusual appearance,
Rama left his brother with Sita, commanding him on no account to quit
her side until he returned from his pursuit of the jewelled deer. The
chase led him to a considerable distance from the hermitage. Weary of
his endeavours to secure the deer, Rama grew angry, and, with one of
his flaming arrows, pierced it in the breast. It bounded off the ground
to the height of a palm tree and, in the act of dying, began to cry,
exactly in the voice of Rama, “Ah! Sita; Ah! Lakshmana.” The words
reached the hermitage, as they were intended to do, and Sita, in an
agony of terror, implored Lakshmana to go to the aid of his brother,
who seemed to be in some dire trouble. Lakshmana, however, protested
that it was all illusion, and refused to believe that Rama could be
in any real danger; for, as he assured the trembling wife, “even the
Almighty Himself with the celestials and the three worlds cannot defeat
him” (Dutt, 609). But Vaidehi took another view of the matter, and
turning sharply upon her brother-in-law accused him roundly of desiring
the destruction of Rama in order that he might gratify an improper wish
to possess her himself. This, indeed, she said, must have been the
reason that brought him all the way from Ayodhya. What, if any, grounds
the charming lady may have had for this accusation does not appear.
They could have been known only to herself and to Lakshmana, who, with
joined hands, humbly reproached her for her cruel words, and bending
low before her went off, with a heavy heart, in search of his brother.

In a garment (probably a _saree_) of yellow silk, Sita sat alone at the
door of her thatched cottage, weeping bitterly, when Ravana presented
himself before her, in the guise of a pious medicant. Ravished by her
beauty, this pious medicant began, without ceremony, to praise the
various charms of Sita’s person with the most reprehensible license
of detail. Nor did he stop there, but telling her that she had carried
away his heart, as a stream carries away its banks, invited her to
accompany him out of the gloomy forest, tenanted by Rakshasas and wild
beasts, and quite unfit for the abode of a goddess like herself.

As her visitor was in appearance a Brahman, she dutifully attended
to him, bringing him water to wash his feet with, and food to eat,
while her eyes were straining through the forest for her absent lord.
Dreading that her Brahman guest might curse her if she did not speak
to him, Vaidehi began to relate the history of her exile, addressing
the seeming medicant in such flattering terms as “thou best of twice
born ones.” After listening to her story, Ravana revealed himself to
her, and again declaring his love, invited her to become his wife in
the great city of Lanka, where she should live in luxury, attended
by five thousand maid-servants. Sita indignantly spurned the offer,
threatening the Rakshasa with the consequences of her husband’s anger.
While indulging in boastful speeches regarding his own prowess, Ravana
assumed his natural form, with ten heads and twenty arms. As he stood
there before Vaidehi, “his eyes were bloody,” and he appeared beautiful
like unto blue clouds, being dressed in gold-hued apparel (Dutt).
Approaching the adorable Sita, the enamoured giant caught her hair with
one hand and her legs with another and carried her off, through the
air, in his golden car drawn by asses. As she was being borne away, the
fair lady cried aloud for help, invoking the sylvan deities to tell
her husband whither, and by whom, she had been carried off. Her voice
reached the virtuous Jatayus, the king of birds, who, though sixty
thousand years old, immediately interposed to rescue her. A furious
and picturesque battle ensued, in which the huge vulture-king, with
his formidable beak, talons, and wings, made a gallant stand against
Ravana, in the cause of virtue and his friend Rama, but eventually lost
his noble life in the struggle, and left his huge bones to mark, to
this day, the scene of his terrible aërial conflict with the demon.[31]
The victorious Ravana carried Sita away through the air in his arms.
Some of her ornaments fell to the ground as the two sped along in their
journey towards Lanka, and showers of blossoms, falling from her head,
were scattered around. At this sorrowful event the sun hid his face and
all nature was oppressed with grief. Not yet despairing of succour,
the brave-hearted Sita observed, as she passed along in mid-air, five
monkey-chiefs seated on the summit of a hill, and, unnoticed by Ravana,
dropped amongst them her gold-coloured sheet and some glittering
ornaments, in the hope that they might convey to Rama the intelligence
of her abduction by the giant. But Fate had more sorrow in store for
her. Over mountain peaks, over rivers, over the sea, Ravana conveyed
his prize without meeting with further opposition, and lodged her
safely in his magnificent palace in Lanka, where he treated her with
the greatest consideration, and wooed her like a youthful lover,
placing her tender feet upon his _heads_ and professing himself her
obedient slave.

                            [Illustration:
                       +THE ABDUCTION OF SITA.+
        (From an illustrated Urdu version of the “Ramayana.”)]

Rama, on discovering the loss he had suffered, was in despair.
Sometimes he would indulge in excessive lamentations, wildly calling
upon the trees and streams, the deer of the forest and the birds of
the air, to tell him where his love had gone. At other times, assuming
a different tone, he would petulantly threaten to destroy “the three
worlds,” if the celestials did not restore Vaidehi to his arms. At such
moments Lakshmana would address his brother in the most abject terms of
flattery, and gently remind him of the necessity of doing his duty and
preserving his dignity.

Roaming about in search of the lost Sita, the brothers came across
Jatayus lying, in mortal agony, amidst the fragments of Ravana’s
wonderful car and his shattered umbrella. All that Rama could learn
from the dying king of the vultures was the name and rank of the
Rakshasa who had carried off his wife, and in a frenzy of grief he
rolled upon the ground, uttering vain lamentations. Presently the
brothers piously erected a funeral pile for the dead bird, and having
cremated the body, proceeded in their search for Sita, when they
encountered a horrid deformed monster, named Kabandha; thus described
by the poet:

  “There stood before their wondering eyes
  A fiend, broad-chested, huge of size;
  A vast misshapen trunk they saw
  In height surpassing nature’s law.
  It stood before them dire and dread,
  Without a neck, without a head,
  Tall as some hill aloft in air,
  Its limbs were clothed with bristling hair,
  And deep below the monster’s waist
  His vast misshapen mouth was placed.
  His form was huge, his voice was loud
  As some dark-tinted thunder-cloud.
  A brilliance as of gushing flame
  Beneath long lashes dark and keen
  The monster’s single eye was seen.”[32]

In the battle which ensued the terrible monster had his two arms cut
off by Rama and Lakshmana respectively, and in this helpless condition
he explained that, though naturally endowed with a surpassingly
beautiful form, he used to assume this monstrous one in order to
frighten the ascetics in the forests; but one of these saints, in a
moment of anger, invoked this curse upon him, that he should retain
the disgusting form he had adopted, at least till, in course of time,
Rama should in person deliver him from its repulsive deformity. The
brothers placed the giant’s bulky body on a funeral pyre, and from
the ashes arose a beautiful being, clad in celestial raiment, at
whose suggestion Rama sought the friendship and aid of Sugriva, King
of the Vanaras, by whose assistance he hoped to find out to what
particular spot his beloved wife had been conveyed by Ravana. Rama,
in due course, found Sugriva and made the acquaintance of his chief
councillor the famous Hanuman, a son of the god of the winds. When Rama
met Sugriva, the latter was, like himself, an exile from his native
land, having been expelled from it by his elder brother, King Bali,
who had also taken unto himself Ruma, Sugriva’s wife. The deposed
monarch was wandering, with a few faithful monkey companions, in the
forest, and it was amongst them, resting together on a mountain peak,
that Sita had dropped her yellow robe and golden ornaments. A sort of
offensive and defensive alliance was formed between the two banished
princes, who were, moreover, drawn towards one another by the fact
that each had been forcibly deprived of his consort. Rama was to help
Sugriva to overthrow Bali, secure the Vanar sceptre and recover his
wife Ruma; while Sugriva, on his part, was to assist Rama to discover
Sita’s whereabouts and to destroy her abductor. So great was the dread
Sugriva entertained of the prowess of his warlike brother Bali, that,
before committing himself to this alliance with Rama, he desired that
prince to give him some practical illustration of what he could do as
a wielder of warlike weapons; whereupon Rama shot from his mighty bow
a wondrous arrow, which, after passing through the stems of seven palm
trees, traversed a hill which stood behind them, then flew through six
subterranean realms and finally returned to the hands of the bowman.
Before this feat all Sugriva’s doubts vanished and he was ready for
action.

At Rama’s suggestion he proceeded to the great Vanar city Kishkindha,
and, in a voice of thunder, dared Bali to single combat. The impetuous
and passionate King of the Vanars accepted the challenge at once,
and an exceedingly fierce encounter took place between the brothers
outside the walls of the city. At length Sugriva seemed to be failing,
when Rama, who was standing by in ambush, pierced Bali in the breast
with one of those fatal arrows of his. As might have been expected,
Bali, with the life-blood welling from his wounds, reproached Rama
bitterly for his base, unfair, and cowardly interposition in the battle
between himself and Sugriva; but Rama justified his action by saying
that he was lord paramount of the whole country, that Kishkindha came
within the realm of Dasahratha, and that Bali had justly forfeited
his life by his misconduct in appropriating his brother’s wife. Rama
further remarked, contemptuously, that the lives of mere Vanars or
monkeys, as of other animals, were of little account in the eyes of
men; a remark which seems strange, indeed, when we reflect that Bali
was the king of a magnificent city decorated with gold, silver and
ivory, and that Bali’s brother was Rama’s much desired ally.[33]

As Bali lay prostrate on the ground his disconsolate queen, Tara,
hastened to the fatal spot, with her little son Angad, and, in a
passion of grief, threw herself upon the body of her husband. She gave
way to the most touching sorrow and lamentation over the dying warrior
and seemed inconsolable, both then and later on when performing the
last rites for the deceased king. Had we seen no more of Tara she
would have lived as a tender and pleasant memory in our minds; but,
unfortunately, she reappears a very short time after as Sugriva’s much
loved and ardent consort, and actually appears grateful to Rama for the
benefit his deed had conferred upon the new king and herself.

By the time Sugriva was formerly installed in the government of
Kishkindha, the rainy season came round,--a time of the year when, in
a roadless country, all military or other movements were impossible.
Rama, faithful to the conditions of his exile, would not enter the
city, and easily contented himself with a life in the woodland, which,
with its glittering fountains and laughing streams, its stately trees,
sweet-throated birds and odorous flowers, he was never tired of
admiring.

In return for the service rendered him by Rama, his ally Sugriva, now
King of the Vanars, assembled countless numbers (hundreds of hundreds
of millions!) of Vanars (monkeys and bears of different colours--white,
yellow and green) and sent them forth to search for Sita. North, south,
east and west, these Vanars traversed every land and searched every
possible retreat. From north, east and west, were received reports
of want of success; but from the south came welcome tidings of the
discovery of Sita by Hanuman, one of the chief captains of the Vanar
host, a son of the wind-god by a nymph of paradise. The discovery of
Sita’s place of captivity was made in this way. In their active search
for traces of her whereabouts, some captains of the Vanar army of the
south came across Sampati, the huge brother of Jatayus, the king of the
vultures, lying upon the top of a high mountain. Bulky and powerful,
the bird was yet quite disabled and helpless, having had his wings
scorched and destroyed in a too adventurous flight towards the sun,
which he had once undertaken in a spirit of vanity and boastfulness.
But even in this unhappy state, dependent for his daily food upon the
filial devotion of his son, the old bird could, with his penetrating
eye, see clearly to enormous distances. He had witnessed Ravana’s
hurried flight through the air, with his beautiful prize, and had noted
also that she had been conveyed by the Rakshasa to Lanka beyond the
sea. This information he now communicated to the inquiring Vanars, and
having thereby performed a signal service to the son of Dasahratha,
his feathers sprouted again and he joyfully mounted once more into his
native element on new and lusty pinions.

Sita’s place of captivity was thus known to the Vanar; but how to
reach Lanka--separated as it was from the mainland by an arm of the
sea--became the urgent problem of the hour to the Vanar commanders
of the army of the south. If Sita was to be restored to the arms of
Rama, it was absolutely necessary that some one should get to Lanka as
a spy, in order to ascertain the facts in regard to Sita’s captivity
there, and to discover the strength of Ravana’s army and his means of
resisting an attack from without. Ships or even boats were, in those
primitive times, not to be thought of; but the monkey could _leap_,
and so it was proposed that some leader of the race should essay the
rather long jump across the strait which separated Lanka from the
continent. Who was so fitted for this undertaking as the son of the
wind-god, the redoubtable Hanuman? Accordingly, after a great deal of
boasting, Hanuman, assuming a gigantic size, took the flying leap. The
gods were well disposed towards his brave venture, but there were also
enemies on the path, who endeavoured to stop him on his way. One of
these was Surasa, the mother of the Nagas, who, rushing upon him with
wide-extended jaws, mockingly told him that he must pass through her
mouth before proceeding any further on his journey. Hanuman dilated
his person till his stature attained many leagues, but the monster’s
mouth grew larger still. The cunning monkey now suddenly contracted
his dimensions to the size of a man’s thumb and jumped airily into and
out of Surasa’s gaping mouth. He had fulfilled his enemy’s conditions
and she good-naturedly acknowledged her defeat. His next opponent, a
terrific she-dragon, the fierce Sinhika, marvellously caught his shadow
as it glided over the sea, and in some mysterious way retarded his
progress thereby. With open mouth she made a furious onslaught upon the
wind-god’s son. Hanuman, equal to the occasion, craftily contracted his
dimensions, and jumping into Sinhika’s cavern-like mouth, inflicted
so much injury upon her that she died. After this interruption he
continued his aërial journey to Lanka, probably making Sinhika’s
carcass the base of a fresh leap towards the island, though this is not
expressly mentioned by the poet.

When he had reached the island-kingdom of Ravana, the Vanar spy,
contracting his dimensions to those of an ordinary cat, found his
way by moonlight within the golden walls of the city, and, lost in
admiration, wandered about the wonderful streets of Ravana’s capital,
where tonsured priests and mail-clad warriors mingled freely with bands
of ascetics in deerskins, and fiends both foul and fair. Eluding the
guards, Hanuman crept into the palace. Here everything was on a scale
to astonish even the wind-god’s son, familiar with the glories of
Kishkindha; but most of all did he find food for admiration in Ravana’s
enchanted car, avowedly the most perfect work that had been produced by
Visvakarma, the architect of the gods.

  “There shone with gems that flashed afar,
  The marvel of the Flower-named car,
  ’Mid wondrous dwellings still confessed
  Supreme and nobler than the rest.
  Thereon with wondrous art designed
  Were _turkis_ birds of varied kind,
  And many a sculptured serpent rolled
  His twisted coil in burnished gold.
  And steeds were there of noblest form,
  With flying feet as fleet as storm;
  And elephants with deftest skill
  Stood sculptured by a silver rill,
  Each bearing on his trunk a wreath
  Of lilies from the flood beneath.
  There Lakshmi, beauty’s heavenly queen,
  Wrought by the artist’s skill was seen
  Beside a flower-clad pool to stand,
  Holding a lotus in her hand.”[34]
                       --+GRIFFITH+ (bk. v., canto vii.).

The zenana or women’s apartment, guarded by she-demons,[35] which
Hanuman next entered in the still hours of the night, when the feast
was over, the music had ceased and all the inmates were hushed in
slumber, affords the poet the opportunity of painting a charming
picture, which the reader will, I am sure, thank me for reproducing
here in Mr. Griffith’s agreeable version:

  “He stood within a spacious hall
  With fretted roof and painted wall,
  The giant Ravan’s boast and pride,
  Loved even as a lovely bride.
  ’Twere long to tell each marvel there,
  The crystal floor, the jewelled stair,
  The gold, the silver, and the shine
  Of crysolite and almandine.
  There breathed the fairest blooms of spring;
  There flashed the proud swan’s silver wing,
  The splendour of whose feathers broke
  Through fragrant wreaths of aloe smoke.
  ‘’Tis Indra’s heaven,’ the Vanar cried,
  Gazing in joy from side to side;
  ‘The home of all the gods is this,
  The mansion of eternal bliss!’
  There were the softest carpets spread,
  Delightful to the sight and tread,
  Where many a lovely woman lay
  O’ercome by sleep, fatigued with play.
  The wine no longer cheered the feast,
  The sound of revelry had ceased.
  The tinkling feet no longer stirred,
  No chiming of a zone was heard.
  So, when each bird has sought her nest,
  And swans are mute and wild bees rest,
  Sleep the fair lilies on the lake
  Till the sun’s kiss shall bid them wake.
  Like the calm field of winter’s sky
  Which stars unnumbered glorify,
  So shone and glowed the sumptuous room
  With living stars that chased the gloom.
  ‘These are the stars,’ the chieftain cried,
  ‘In autumn nights that earthward glide,
  In brighter forms to reappear
  And shine in matchless lustre here.’
  With wondering eyes awhile he viewed
  Each graceful form and attitude.
  One lady’s head was backward thrown,
  Bare was her arm and loose her zone.
  The garland that her brow had graced
  Hung closely round another’s waist.
  Here gleamed two little feet all bare
  Of anklets that had sparkled there.
  Here lay a queenly dame at rest
  In all her glorious garments dressed.
  There slept another whose small hand
  Had loosened every tie and band.
  In careless grace another lay,
  With gems and jewels cast away,
  Like a young creeper when the tread
  Of the wild elephant had spread
  Confusion and destruction round,
  And cast it flowerless to the ground.
  Here lay a slumberer still as death,
  Save only that her balmy breath
  Raised ever and anon the lace
  That floated o’er her sleeping face.
  There, sunk in sleep, an amorous maid
  Her sweet head on a mirror laid,
  Like a fair lily bending till
  Her petals rest upon the rill.
  Another black-eyed damsel pressed
  Her lute upon her heaving breast,
  As though her loving arms were twined
  Round him for whom her bosom pined.
  Another pretty sleeper round
  A silver vase her arms had wound,
  That seemed, so fresh and fair and young,
  A wreath of flowers that o’er it hung.
  In sweet disorder lay a throng
  Weary of dance and play and song,
  Where heedless girls had sunk to rest,
  One pillowed on another’s breast,
  Her tender cheek half seen beneath
  Red roses of the falling wreath,
  The while her long soft hair concealed
  The beauties that her friend revealed.
  With limbs at random interlaced
  Round arm and leg and throat and waist,
  That wreath of women lay asleep
  Like blossoms in a careless heap.”[36]
                       --+GRIFFITH+ (bk. v., canto ix.).

Still in eager quest of Sita the Vanar roamed stealthily from place to
place within the spacious bounds of the royal palace, and, as day was
breaking, entered the enchanting ashoka grove, a sort of ideal retreat
in fairyland. Here Rama’s messenger discovered the weeping, but still
peerless, captive, guarded by fierce she-demons of monstrous shapes--a
weird, frightful troupe--some earless, some with ears hanging down to
their feet, some one-eyed, some long-necked and covered with hair, some
huge, some dwarfish, some with faces of buffaloes, others with the
heads of dogs and swine. Perched upon a bough, and concealed by its
foliage, Hanuman watched his opportunity to open communication with
the object of his search. Presently Ravana, in great state, heralded
by music and attended by a crowd of ravishing beauties, with tinkling
zones, entered the grove. Sita, in utter despair, fell upon the ground

  “Like Hope when all her dreams are o’er.”

Approaching her kindly, the King of Lanka, who was passionately
enamoured of her beauty, endeavoured to reassure her, and wooed her
softly with all the arts of flattery, with offers of boundless wealth,
and with protestations of deep affection.

  “Methinks when thy sweet form was made
  His hand the wise Creator stayed;
  For never more could he design
  A beauty meet to rival thine.
  Come let us love while yet we may,
  For youth will fly and charms decay.”
                           --+GRIFFITH.+

Sita, ever faithful to her lord, treated his suit with scorn; whereupon
the demon king, waxing wrath, threatened to have her killed and served
up at his table if she persisted in rejecting his advances. Turning
to leave the palace in high dudgeon, he directed the demon guards to
bend the fair captive to his will by threats and blandishments of every
kind. Their persuasions being unsuccessful, these horrid monsters
assailed the unfortunate princess with threatening weapons; but even in
this critical moment the pure, chaste wife of Rama preferred death to
dishonour.[37]

Amidst the persecutions of the luckless Sita an old Rakshasa matron,
named Trajata, raised a warning voice; for she had dreamed a dream
which foreboded the destruction of Lanka by Rama, and she counselled
the demons to deal kindly by Sita, if they hoped for mercy from the
conquerors.

It seems necessary to explain now that it was not a sense of honour
or a feeling of chivalry that had restrained the unscrupulous King of
Lanka from the gratification of his passion. It was fear only that kept
him back; for, as he confidentially explained to his assembled lords,
having once, under the influence of ungovernable desire, dishonoured
one of the nymphs of Indra’s heaven, fair Punjikashthala, Brahma had
decreed that if Ravana committed the same offence again his head should
be rent in pieces. Of course this fact and the protection thus enjoyed
by Sita, through dread of Brahma’s decree, were quite unknown to Rama,
whose knowledge was merely human.

At length the Vanar found the long wished-for opportunity of
communicating with Sita and of consoling her with the hope of an
early rescue. He even offered to carry her off, there and then,
on his shoulders, but her modesty shrank from the mere thought of
voluntarily touching the body of any male person beside Rama. The
monkey-god then set about committing as much destruction as he could
in the city of Lanka, which, built by Visvakarma, the architect of the
gods, is described as surpassingly beautiful and encircled by a golden
wall. After a succession of fierce and successful battles with the
giants--thousands at the time with their most famous captains--Hanuman,
covered from head to foot with wounds, was _noosed_ by means of a magic
shaft from the bow of Ravana’s son, Indrajit, overpowered and taken
prisoner. Exceedingly incensed, Ravana ordered the destructive and
formidable Vanar to be put to death at once. One of his counsellors,
however, suggesting that Hanuman might be regarded in the light of an
envoy from Rama, it was decided to spare his life, but, at the same
time, to treat him with the greatest indignity before releasing him. In
pursuance of this determination his tail was wrapped round with cloth
dipped in oil, which was then set on fire; but at the prayer of Sita,
who came to know what was going on in the city, the flames abstained
from harming her friend. By contracting his dimensions, Hanuman easily
freed himself from his bonds, and now, by means of his blazing tail,
carried fire and destruction through the beautiful city; after which he
once more performed his perilous journey through the air, back to the
mainland of India, bearing tidings of his doings to his master and Rama.

When the place of Sita’s captivity became known, the Vanar armies were
rapidly advanced southward, and encamped on the border of the strait
which separates Lanka from the mainland of India. Here they were
joined by Vibhishana, Ravana’s brother, who, with four attendants, had
fled through the air from Lanka, in dread of the consequences of the
offence he had given his king, by counselling conciliatory proceedings
towards Rama, of whose formidable prowess he seems to have formed a
just estimate.

Vibhishana, on account of his local knowledge and great wisdom, was of
much service to the Vanar host.

The sea, although it could be crossed by the Rakshasas and by the
wind-god’s son, Hanuman, was a serious impediment to Rama and his Vanar
allies. Standing on the margin of the trackless ocean which barred his
march, the chief vented his impatience in a shower of his wonderful
arrows, which he angrily shot into the wide bosom of the deep. His
attack stirred the waters to their very depths and terrified its
strange denizens out of their wits. As the hero laid against his bow
a more formidable arrow than the rest (a fiery dart of mystic power),
by means of which he threatened to dry up the waters of the sea and
pass his legions over on dry land, all Nature was horrified, darkness
fell upon land and sea, bright meteors flashed across the murky sky,
red lightning struck the trembling earth, and the firm mountains
began to break and crumble away. At this critical moment of universal
terror the grand form of the king of the ocean, attended by glittering
sea-serpents, rose majestically above the seething billows of his
watery realm.[38] Addressing Rama with great reverence, the ocean-king
protested that it was impossible to make a dry pathway through the sea.

  “Air, ether, fire, earth, water, true
  To Nature’s will, their course pursue;
  And I, as ancient laws ordain,
  Unfordable must still remain.”
                           --+GRIFFITH.+

But he advised that Nala, a Vanar chief, who was the son of the
architect of the gods (Visvakarma) should be requested to bridge the
strait that intervened between Rama and the object of his expedition.
Nala undertook the work, and, under his direction, the bridge was
successfully completed. The construction of the bridge was not opposed,
nor the passage disputed, so the countless hosts[39] of Vanars passed
over to the island, with Rama mounted on Hanuman’s back, Lakshmana on
Angad’s back, and camped[40] near Ravana’s capital. Even at this stage
of events Ravana, still under the spell of his passion for the lovely
Sita, resorted to a stratagem to obtain her consent to his wishes.
He got a magician of his court to prepare a head exactly resembling
Rama’s, and also a bow and arrows such as the hero usually carried, and
had them brought into Sita’s presence, with the tale that her lord had
been killed while asleep in his camp. Sita, completely deceived by the
wizard’s art, was lamenting her bitter loss, when a messenger hurriedly
summoned Ravana away to see to the defence of his capital, and a female
attendant took advantage of the moment to relieve the fair captive’s
mind, by explaining the deception that had been practised upon her.

The attack that shortly followed and the defence made by the giants
are described by Valmiki in considerable detail, and with much
monotonous repetition. The Vanars had, for arms, uprooted trees,
rocks, and mountain peaks; while the Rakshasas fought with bows and
arrows, swords and spears. Many single combats are described. Indrajit,
the redoubtable son of Ravana, in a desperate encounter, concealed
himself in a magic mist. Under this protection he fired some wondrous
serpent-arrows at Rama and Lakshmana, which bound the royal brothers
in a noose. He then, with a storm of missiles, laid them prostrate and
apparently dying. But it was not thus that the contest was to end. From
their helpless condition Rama and Lakshmana were freed by Garuda, who,
as the king of birds, possessed a special power over the serpent-arrows.

On another occasion Rama with his brother Lakshmana, both sorely
wounded, and ever so many of their Vanar allies, were restored to
life and vigour, by the scent of some healing herbs brought by the
swift-footed Hanuman from the distant Himalayas. In the combats around
the walls of Lanka, as in other contests narrated in the “Ramayana,”
the poet describes the power of the various archers to interrupt
_with their arrows_ the shafts of their adversaries, or even the most
ponderous missiles hurled at them, such as trees and rocks.

With varying success the fierce contest raged round the walls of Lanka,
when at length the giants, sorely pressed, called upon Kumbhakarna to
assist them. This dreadful monster was Ravana’s brother and a terror to
men and gods. At his birth, or shortly after it, he devoured a thousand
men. Indra interposed to save the human race from his ravages, but
only to be himself discomfited and driven to seek the protection of
Brahma, who decreed that Kumbhakarna should sleep for six months at a
time, and then only wake for a single day. The mere appearance of the
monstrous giant caused a panic in the Vanar army. Multitudes perished
under Kumbhakarna’s arm and were devoured by him; but such was his
voracity that he captured and flung thousands of living Vanars into his
mouth, out of which some fortunate ones managed to escape, through his
nostrils and ears. But formidable as he was, Kumbhakarna at length fell
by a crescent-headed arrow from Rama’s bow.

  “Through skin and flesh and bone it smote,
  And rent asunder head and throat.
  Down, with the sound of thunder, rolled
  The head adorned with rings of gold,
  And crushed to pieces in its fall
  A gate, a tower, a massive wall.
  Hurled to the sea the body fell,
  Terrific was the ocean’s swell,
  Nor could swift fin and nimble leap
  Save the crushed creatures of the deep.”
                             --+GRIFFITH+ (bk. vi., canto lxvii.).

One memorable episode in this siege of Lanka was a night attack,
planned and successfully carried out by Sugriva. Overpowering the
guards, the Vanars entered the city, and, amidst the most terrible
carnage, gave beautiful and stately Lanka over to the flames:

  “As earth with fervent head will glow
  When comes her final overthrow;
  From gate to gate, from court to spire,
  Proud Lanka was one blaze of fire,
  And every headland, rock and bay
  Shone bright a hundred leagues away!”
                          --+GRIFFITH.+

Succeeding this night attack came the final struggle. Ravana sallied
forth from Lanka with a marvellous array of chariots,[41] elephants,
horses, and men. He himself was the most formidable adversary yet
encountered by Rama, having in his time subjugated the Nagas, defeated
the gods of heaven, and even successfully invaded the land of departed
spirits, ruled over by the dreaded Yama. During the battle that ensued,
Indra, anxious, no doubt, to pay off old scores, sent his own chariot
to Rama, who, mounted on it, encountered Ravana in single combat, and
after a long contest killed his adversary with an arrow which had been
made by Brahma himself. As the giant fell, celestial music filled the
air, perfumed breezes wandered pleasantly over the field, and heavenly
blossoms were rained down upon the conquering hero, the champion of the
gods.

With the death of Ravana the war was at an end, and Vibhishana was
installed king in his place. Sita, so long and so ardently sought,
was now brought forth in state from Lanka, borne in a screened litter
on the shoulders of sturdy Rakshasas, to meet her victorious lord.
The inquisitive Vanars pressed round to see Vaidehi, on whose account
they had so often risked their lives; but the attendants rudely drove
them back. Rama, however, interposing, commanded that the lady should
descend from the litter and proceed on foot, unveiled, so that his
Vanar friends might have a good look at her; for, as he said:

  “At holy rites, in war and woe
  Her face unveiled a dame may show;
  When at the maiden’s choice they meet,
  When marriage troops parade the street.
  And she, my queen, who long has lain
  In prison, racked with care and pain,
  May cease awhile her face to hide,
  For is not Rama by her side?”

The meeting between Rama and his long-lost queen is a highly dramatic
and unexpected scene. Instead of Rama folding his darling in his arms,
as one might have expected he would have done, after all his piteous
laments about her loss and his often expressed desire to possess
his peerless wife once more, we find him coldly repulsing her, on
the ground of her long captivity in Ravana’s power. More than that,
he cruelly tells her that it was not love for her, but a desire to
vindicate his outraged honour, that had brought him to Lanka. Quite
unprepared for this undeserved and heartless reception, poor Vaidehi
asks her husband most touchingly if the past is all forgotten, if her
love and unfaltering devotion have quite faded from his memory? And,
waxing sadly indignant, she requests Lakshmana, in a voice broken with
sobs, to prepare a funeral pile for her, the only refuge she had left
to her in her dark despair. With Rama’s tacit consent the pyre was
erected and ignited. Boldly did the virtuous queen enter the flames,
and as she fell overpowered by them a cry of grief rose from the
bystanders. At this important moment a band of celestial beings, headed
by Brahma himself, appeared before the assembled multitude and revealed
to Rama his true nature, that he was Vishnu and no mortal man, while
the god of fire raised Sita out of the flames, and, publicly attesting
her purity, restored her to Rama, who now joyfully received her back
to his heart and home. Before the gods departed to their celestial
abodes, Indra, at Rama’s considerate request, restored to life all the
Vanars who had fallen in his cause. Thus was the great war brought to a
conclusion.

Rama now proceeded to Ayodhya, carried aloft through the clouds, over
sea and land, in the famous magic car _Pushpak_, already referred to.
With the returning hero went Sita and Lakshmana, the Vanar chiefs and
Vibhishana too. After a meeting with his brother Bharata, who came
forth with joy to welcome him back, Rama assumed the government of
Dasahratha’s kingdom, and reigned over it for ten thousand years.[42]

But his life and Sita’s had still more trouble in them. The people of
Ayodhya mocked at Rama for taking back his wife, after she had been
so long in the giant’s power. They even attributed a famine which
desolated the land to the anger of the gods on account of Rama’s
conduct. About to become a mother, Sita expressed a great desire to
visit the forest hermitages of the saints. Her husband accorded his
consent to her wishes, and directed Lakshmana to conduct her thither.
Unable to endure the jibes of his people, Rama resolved to abandon his
innocent, unsuspecting wife, alone and unprotected, in the immense
forests of Dandhaka, near the sources of the Godavari. The bitter duty
was intrusted to Lakshmana, who, ever obedient, carried it out to the
letter. Alas! poor Vaidehi, such was the reward of her pure, unselfish
love and devotion through many trying years of hardship and sorrow!
Cast adrift, alone in the pathless wilderness, Sita was found by the
saint Valmiki himself, and tenderly entertained by the holy women of
the hermitage. Shortly after this she gave birth to twin sons, who
were named Kusa and Lava. In his forest-home, Valmiki, under divine
inspiration, composed the “Ramayana,” and taught the sons of Sita
to recite the immortal epic. On the occasion of a grand ceremony at
Ayodhya, Kusa and Lava had the honour of reciting the great poem in
the presence of their father, who, after inquiry, acknowledged them as
his sons, and invited Sita to come forward and assert her innocence
publicly.

                            [Illustration:

     HANUMAN AND THE VANARS REJOICING AT THE RESTORATION OF SITA.
               (Reduced from Moor’s “Hindu Pantheon.”)]

 “But Sita’s heart was too full, this second ordeal was beyond even her
 power to submit to, and the poet rose above the ordinary Hindu level
 of women when he ventured to paint her conscious purity as rebelling.
 Beholding all the spectators, and clothed in red garments, Sita,
 clasping her hands, and bending low her face, spoke thus in a voice
 choked with tears: ‘As I, even in mind, have never thought of any
 other person than Rama, so may Madhavi, the goddess of earth, grant
 me a hiding-place.’ As Sita made the oath, lo! a marvel appeared.
 Suddenly cleaving the earth, a divine throne of marvellous beauty rose
 up, borne by resplendent dragons on their heads, and seated on it the
 goddess of earth, raising Sita with her arm, said to her, ‘Welcome to
 thee,’ and placed her by her side. And as the queen, seated on the
 throne, slowly descended to Hades, a continuous shower of flowers fell
 down from Heaven on her head.”[43]

Thus in sadness, and with the sting of injustice rankling in her heart,
does the gentle Sita disappear for ever.

In bidding farewell to Vaidehi we would notice that throughout this
epic all the female characters are much more human than those of the
opposite sex, and, in their genuine womanhood, they naturally interest
us in a far greater degree than the heroes of the story, be they lofty
demigods, cruel Rakshasas, volatile Vanars, or Rishis endowed with
superhuman powers.

We have yet to trace the further fortunes of the sons of Dasahratha.
When Rama had reigned for a long period at Ayodhya, Time, as an
ascetic, sought an interview with him, at which no one might intrude on
pain of certain death. As messenger from Brahma, Time explained to Rama
his real nature and position, leaving it to him to continue longer on
earth or to return to heaven. During the interview an impatient Rishi
desired immediate audience of Rama. Lakshmana, who knew the penalty
of intruding upon him at this moment, raised some difficulties; but
the irate saint threatened to launch a curse against Rama and all his
kinsfolk if he were not admitted to his presence forthwith. Lakshmana,
dreading, for Rama’s sake, the Rishi’s curse, interrupted his interview
with Time and thereby incurred the penalty of death. Lakshmana
accordingly went to the river Surayu and was thence conveyed bodily to
heaven. Rama, accompanied by his brothers Bharata and Satrughna, and
attended by the goddess of earth, also by _all his weapons in human
shapes, the Vedas in the form of Brahmans_, and his women and servants,
proceeded to the Surayu and entered its waters. As he did so the voice
of Brahma was heard from the sky, saying: “Approach, Vishnu, Raghav,
thou hast happily arrived with thy godlike brothers. Enter thine own
body as Vishnu or the eternal ether.” He and his followers were then
all of them translated to heaven.[44]

Such is the famous story of Rama and Sita. Ordinary men and women
are of little account and scarcely figure at all amongst the poet’s
creations. Nearly everything in the “Ramayana” is superhuman. The dire
conflicts which occupy so large a part of the epic are waged between
demigods and fiends, or giants. The weapons employed are celestial, or
perhaps only charmed. Mystic spells are of the greatest efficacy, and
the results are proportionally great.

In the war that raged around the walls of Ilium the gods did,
certainly, interfere in the combats, and sometimes unfairly too;
they even attacked each other occasionally; but, notwithstanding the
supernatural element, the Trojan war was still a war of men and heroes.
Not so that which ensanguined the hills and plains of Lanka.

The India of the “Ramayana” was covered with forests, and it is
noteworthy that Rama’s progress is traced rather from forest to forest
than from city to city, which last were very few and far between.

The hero of the tale is a very different one from those who figure
in the Homeric poems. As a son he is most dutiful, pushing the idea
of filial respect and obedience to the extreme, bearing no enmity
even towards his designing stepmother. As a layman he is religious
and unfeignedly respectful to Brahmans and saints. As a prince he
is patriotic and benign; as a warrior, skilful and fearless in the
fight. As an elder brother, however, he is often somewhat exacting and
inconsiderate, and as a husband his behaviour is, to say the least,
disappointing. On the whole the prominent characteristic of this hero,
limned by Brahman artists, is a spirit of mild self-sacrifice, as
distinguished from bold self-assertion.

The reader who has glanced through even the brief epitome of Valmiki’s
poem now presented will not have omitted to note the wealth of
imagination displayed by the author or authors, nor will he have failed
to be charmed by many a beautiful picture and many an interesting
situation.




                              CHAPTER III

                     THE RAM LILA OR PLAY OF RAMA


Let us now see how the stirring events of this Indian epic are brought
dramatically before nineteenth century spectators.

Days before the time fixed for the Dasahra festival, men, done up like
monkeys and attended by drummers, may be seen in the bazaars collecting
money for the fair, at which the more striking leading incidents of
the epic are annually performed, part by part, in a rude pantomimic
fashion. Sometimes the opening scene is a great marriage procession.
One such, on an unusually large scale, was got up in Lahore in 1884,
at the expense of certain rich bankers. This motley and gigantic
procession was made up of very heterogeneous elements. Several camels
led the way; some bulky elephants put in an appearance, and a great
number of mounted men, on good cavalry horses, gave dignity to the
procession. Three or four well-filled carriages, gaily decorated with
tinsel, flowers and coloured cloths, had the honour of accommodating
the friends of Rama. A few huge litters, each borne aloft on the
shoulders of sixteen or twenty bearers, were conspicuous objects in the
throng. On some of these sat men personating the gods and goddesses of
India in all their grotesqueness; on others squatted favourite female
singers with their attendant minstrels, who delighted the audience with
their grace and vocal performances. Imitation artillery armed with
explosive bombs, dancers, mountebanks, musicians, and an innumerable
crowd of ordinary citizens on foot, raised noise and dust enough to
gratify the most pleasure-seeking Indian mob. The hero, Rama, and his
inseparable brother, were dragged along on wooden horses, placed on
a wheeled platform. There they sat, side by side, holding tiny bows
and arrows in their hands, in a most ridiculous way, while the less
important mythological personages, divine or other, came along in
carriages or litters. There was a painful want of organization about
the procession, and the usual mixture of the sumptuous and tawdry, the
rich and squalid, to which one is accustomed in India.

A feature of the Dasahra festival is the number of men, disfigured
with paint and ashes, who go about with iron skewers or pieces of cane
passed through the skin of their arms, legs, sides, and throat, or even
through the tongue. I once called up a party of these men and examined
them. In answer to my remark, thrown out as a feeler, that the skewers
had been passed through old perforations, the leader of the party
indignantly pulled a young man before me, pinched up a good bit of the
skin of his forearm, and there and then passed a blunt iron needle
through it, which could not have been much thinner than an ordinary
lead pencil. No blood flowed, and certainly the man operated upon did
not wince in the slightest degree. After this the leader of the party,
having satisfied me that the skin of his own neck below the chin was
perfectly sound, passed a skewer through it with his own hand. In
both cases a tolerable amount of force was necessary to pass the iron
through the skin, but no blood flowed. These men, who are looked upon
with a sort of awe by the vulgar, assured me that they were protected
from pain or injury by a secret _mantra_ of Guru Gorucknath’s known
only to themselves. They have probably learned, by the experience of
many generations, safe places for the insertion of their skewers; but
I was told by a native medical man that serious consequences sometimes
follow their senseless ill-treatment of their own persons. The present
of a rupee sent these absurd fellows away apparently well satisfied.

Near the temple of Vishnu, by Rattan Singh’s Serai, arrangements had
been made for a dramatic representation of Rama’s famous history.
When I first came upon the spot there were five or six hundred
people assembled. The women and children, arrayed in their holiday
best, crowded the roofs of the surrounding buildings to witness the
performance and, with the gay red and yellow of their dresses and their
tinkling anklets, gave colour and animation to the scene. Men and boys
were below. Three merry-go-rounds of the kind patronized by the people,
were in full operation, creaking hideously.

Of the Ram Lila itself the only signs were two wooden horses, like
those to be seen in European nurseries, only nearly life-size,
standing, side by side, on a single wooden platform placed on wheels:
They were painted white, with gaudy patches of red all over them. A few
boys with monkey-masks on, capered about with switches in their hands.
The crowd gradually increased, and the arrival of the performers was
eagerly expected. But even yet some money-making bunniahs, surrounded
by their pots and pans, their jars and other vessels, were busily
plying their trade in oil, right in the midst of the assembling crowd;
while on one side several women kept diligently separating the chaff
from the wheat and sending clouds of dust amongst the spectators. At
length a great shout announced the arrival of Rama and Lakshmana,
who were carried in a gaudy litter on the shoulders of a number
of men. This was the signal for the commencement of business. The
crowd began to settle down. The central space was cleared. Rama and
Lakshmana walked bare-footed round the arena, showing themselves to the
spectators. They were attired in yellow garments adorned with tinsel,
and had on their heads high and much decorated hats, which, I happened
to learn subsequently, cost just _three rupees_ each. Garlands of
flowers encircled their necks, and their hats were literally covered
with floral wreaths. Their faces were thickly painted with what looked
like yellow tumeric, daubed over with some red powder, these pigments
being, no doubt, considered most suitable for imparting beauty to
an Indian complexion. The brothers carried small bows, like those
usually placed in the hands of Cupids, and were attended by a man who
vigorously waved a _chowree_ over their heads. After this preliminary
exhibition, during which several masked figures began to appear on the
scene, a white-headed Brahman, book in hand (it was the Hindi version
of Tulsi Das[45]) began to instruct the performers in their several
parts. Seated all together--demigods, monkeys, and Brahman--in the open
space, before all the spectators, they learned the first act of the
day’s performance. In deference to their position, and probably also
out of consideration for their fine clothes, Rama and his brother were
made to sit on a white sheet, whilst the others squatted comfortably
in the dust. When the actors had received their instructions, they
proceeded to carry them out in a style which rendered it very
difficult to comprehend what they actually meant to represent; but the
Hindu spectators, familiar with the old tale and its usual dramatic
rendering, seemed to recognize at least the leading events which it
was intended to bring before them. At the conclusion of the act, or
scene, Rama and his brother, with the rest, came together again to
receive their instructions from the old Brahman stage-manager, and,
when duly instructed, again dispersed to perform their several parts
in a more or less imperfect manner. One portion of the performance
consisted in dragging the brothers round the arena on their wooden
horses. The acting or pantomime was very rude, and the whole seemed
childish in the extreme. But the old story, thus brought before them,
was evidently as much appreciated by the spectators as it had been by
their ancestors for fifty generations. And rude and childish though
the performance might be, it was probably not more so than the Miracle
Plays which delighted our forefathers in the Middle Ages.

The dramatic representation extended over several days, the most
popular scenes being the amputation of Surpanakha’s nose and the
abduction of Sita. The former, a mere rough and tumble performance,
without anything striking or dramatic about it, was greeted with
uproarious mirth by the spectators, and may, possibly, be the original
suggestion and sanction of much of the female nose-cutting so commonly
practised in India by jealous husbands. In the other scene Ravana
appeared as a hermit. The supernatural doe was dragged about the
arena. Rama and his brother were, of course, lured into pursuit of the
deceiver and Sita, left alone, was carried off by Ravana. Jatayus, the
vulture king,--represented by a huge paper bird carried about by a man
hither and thither in a wild sort of way,--rushed to the rescue of
the fair dame; but after a brief, though fierce, struggle was hacked
to pieces by the demon. After this lamentable encounter, Sita, to the
great grief of the onlookers, was carried away to Lanka.

The downfall of Lanka and final triumph of Rama are scenes of too
great importance to be dealt with like the rest. For these, special
preparations and as large a theatre as possible--some wide open plain
for example--are requisite, as thousands gather to see Lanka and the
demons given over to the flames.

I select for description a favourable instance of the siege and
destruction of Lanka which I witnessed at the military station of Meean
Meer a few years ago. It was got up by the sepoys of some of the native
regiments stationed there.

Upon an open _maidan_ or plain was assembled an eager crowd of
spectators. A large space for the performance of the Ram Lila was kept
clear by sepoys, placed as sentries at short intervals. About the
centre of this space towered two huge effigies, without legs, probably
forty feet high, representing Ravana and Kumbhakarna. Each figure stood
with its arms extended right and left, level with the shoulders, in the
most absurd of attitudes, resembling the pictures of men which young
children are so fond of drawing. Ravana had ten faces,[46] and two arms
with twenty hands,[47] while Kumbhakarna had two hands only. There they
stood, the terrible demon king of Lanka, and his no less formidable
brother, grotesqueness itself. At one side, opposite to and facing the
figures, was a painted wooden car--lent by the king of the celestials
to Rama on this memorable occasion--standing on small wheels, like a
child’s toy, with two wooden horses attached to it. On the car were
seated two handsome, bare-legged and bare-footed boys, dressed in
yellow satin robes, with bows in their hands. Their hats somewhat
resembled a bishop’s mitre in shape, and were made of red and silver
materials. These boys, the reader does not need to be told, represented
Rama and his brother Lakshmana. In attendance upon them were about
thirty men, dressed in dusky red clothes, and with marks on their
faces, who personated the army of monkeys that assisted the heroes. To
the right of the two huge figures was an inclosed space which stood for
the city or citadel of Lanka. Various mythological figures were also to
be seen moving about the plain, in a more or less objectless manner.
Two tall men, got up as women, went springing about, brandishing naked
swords. They represented female Rakshasas. A man dressed up to look
very corpulent, clothed in yellow, with long flowing hair and having
serpents coiled round his throat, was dragged about upon a wooden bull
over the field. This corpulent personage was no other than Mahadeva
(_Siva_) on his bull (_Nandi_). Thus far the show was, at least,
mythological and _Hindu_. But, by a curious anachronism, the features
of a modern fair mixed themselves up with the old-world representation.
Perhaps Indian taste in this nineteenth century demanded something
more than the undiluted ancient epic. Whatever may have been the
cause, I observed, with surprise, that within the inclosure several
natives with painted faces personated Europeans of both sexes, to the
great amusement of the onlookers. A man in shaggy furs, holding a
torn umbrella over his head, and attended by a fellow disguised as a
European policeman, was announced to the spectators as the “Nawab of
Cabul.” There were also imitation bears with their leaders and such
like grotesque shows for the amusement of the populace. Although the
vast majority of the spectators were natives, many Europeans were
present, some in their carriages, some on elephants, and one or two
on camels. The scene, which was certainly strange and picturesque,
became especially lively when, towards the close of the proceedings,
the explosion of bombs and the discharge of rockets alarmed the horses
and elephants. One huge beast, carrying a European gentleman and three
ladies in a big _howdah_, was an object of interest and a cause of some
anxiety to me, for his restive and erratic movements seemed to threaten
destruction to me or to my carriage, at the least.
